Abstract:
The project titled “Blockchain-Based Medical Data Management System” aims to enhance the security, transparency, and integrity of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). Traditional medical data systems are centralized and prone to unauthorized modifications, single points of failure, and data leakage.
This project utilizes blockchain technology to store and manage medical data in a decentralized manner, ensuring that each record is tamper-proof, traceable, and verifiable. By implementing role-based access for different stakeholders—doctors, patients, laboratories, and third-party users—the system ensures controlled visibility and improved accountability across all operations.

Objectives

To design a blockchain-based data management system for secure handling of medical records.
To ensure immutability and transparency through cryptographic hash linking of medical data.
To provide role-based authentication and access for doctors, patients, lab technicians, and authorized third parties.
To minimize the chances of data manipulation and enable efficient data verification using Proof of Work (PoW).
To overcome limitations of conventional EMR systems by implementing distributed, timestamped data recording.

Proposed System

The proposed system integrates a blockchain ledger with traditional database management to combine the advantages of decentralization and structured data handling.
Each medical record generated by a doctor or lab technician is converted into a block, hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm, and linked to the previous block, forming an immutable chain.
The blockchain server validates each block through Proof of Work before adding it to the chain, maintaining integrity and synchronization among all modules.
Users interact with the system through a GUI developed in Java Swing, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

Modules Implemented

Doctor Module:
Registers and authenticates doctors.
Allows doctors to add or update medical records for patients.
Sends data to the blockchain server for validation and chaining.

Patient Module:
Enables patient registration and login.
Provides functionality to view medical data stored on the blockchain.
Ensures patient control over sharing and access permissions.

Lab Technician Module:

Allows labs to upload diagnostic reports associated with patients.
Implements OTP-based verification before report submission.
Sends verified reports to the blockchain.

Guest / Third Party Module:

Provides limited access to authorized external users (e.g., insurance firms).
Data retrieval is based on patient Appointment ID and Date of Birth.

Server Module:

Validates blocks submitted by other modules.
Performs Proof of Work (difficulty level = 5).
Verifies timestamp order, hash correctness, and link integrity.
Stores all valid blocks in the blockchain ledger (JSON format).

Database Module (DBPack):

Manages MySQL database connections.
Handles storage of user credentials, appointments, and activity logs.
Acts as an interface between the blockchain server and front-end modules.

Implementation Details

Programming Language: Java (Swing GUI)
Database: MySQL
Blockchain Algorithm: SHA-256
Difficulty Level: 5 (Proof of Work)
Data Format: JSON
Communication: Socket Programming between clients and blockchain server
Verification: Manual verification of block hashes and timestamps

System Workflow

The doctor or lab generates a new medical record.
The record is converted into a JSON block and sent to the server.
The server validates it by computing the hash with required difficulty.
Upon validation, the block is added to the blockchain ledger.
Patients and authorized third parties can access verified data via their modules.

Results

The system successfully demonstrates secure, immutable medical data storage using blockchain principles.
Role-based access ensures that only authenticated users can interact with specific data.
Proof of Work guarantees the integrity and authenticity of records.
JSON-based block structures allow transparency and ease of verification.
Manual testing confirmed that tampering with any block breaks the hash chain, ensuring trustworthiness of the system.
